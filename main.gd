#Tetris TO DO:
#Create sprites for all of the blocks, and assign them to a number in an array may need to do something similar to snake segments?
#Add timer for block'w movement
#Add random block selecyion + new block once old block gone
#Make it so blocks disappear and score goes up when you have a solid line
#make it possible to rotate pieces and bring them down faster
#rotate 90 degrees
#Piece preview

#Background is roughly 0-480px x 0-1500px y it should fit 10 squares so each movement is -+ 48
#For my pieces I can use either 2D collision logic or keep track of the individual squares 
#I will be going with collision logic as I believe it will be beneficial to easier piece interactions

#Variables for the pieces
